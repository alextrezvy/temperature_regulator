Thermo-couple-based temperature regulator allows to maintain near-constant temperature by automatically turning a resistive load on and off.
Can be used in soldering irons, electric ovens, etc. A thermo-couple must be electrically isolated from metal parts, as it has no galvanic isolation from the power line.
